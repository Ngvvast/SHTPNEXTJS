Navigating the Nexus: A Cybersecurity Risk Model and Recommendation Framework for UK Healthcare in the Age of NIS2, COVID-19 Legacy, and Generative AI
1. Introduction
1.1 Context Setting
The United Kingdom's healthcare sector stands as a cornerstone of national infrastructure, increasingly reliant on a complex web of digital technologies to deliver patient care, manage operations, and drive medical innovation (CrowdStrike, 2023). This digital transformation, while offering significant benefits, concurrently exposes the sector to a sophisticated and evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats (Allam et al., 2022). Compounding this inherent vulnerability is the convergence of several powerful external forces: stringent new cybersecurity regulations exemplified by the EU's Network and Information Systems 2 (NIS2) Directive and the UK's corresponding legislative updates (NIS2Directive.eu, n.d.-a); the persistent cybersecurity weaknesses and altered working practices stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic (Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, 2020); and the disruptive potential and novel risks introduced by the rapid advancement of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) (Bedfordshire, Luton and Milton Keynes ICB, n.d.). The critical nature of healthcare services means that cyber incidents can have severe consequences, extending beyond financial and reputational damage to directly impact patient safety and care delivery (American Hospital Association, n.d.).
1.2 Problem Statement
The confluence of regulatory pressure (NIS2/UK Bill), pandemic-induced vulnerabilities, and the emergence of GenAI creates a uniquely challenging and significantly heightened cybersecurity risk environment for the UK healthcare sector (American Hospital Association, n.d.). Traditional cybersecurity approaches, often focused on perimeter defence and reactive incident response, may prove insufficient against the multifaceted threats posed by sophisticated supply chain attacks, AI-enhanced social engineering, data poisoning of machine learning models, and the exploitation of expanded remote working infrastructures. A more strategic, proactive, and holistic risk management framework is required to build resilience and ensure the continued safety and security of UK healthcare operations and sensitive patient data.
1.3 Report Objectives
This report aims to deliver an expert-level cybersecurity risk model and recommendation framework specifically tailored for the UK healthcare sector. The primary objectives are:
To analyze the specific cybersecurity risks and impacts stemming from the NIS2 Directive (and the UK's Cyber Security and Resilience Bill alignment), the legacy of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the rise of Generative AI.
To evaluate the effectiveness and limitations of existing cybersecurity solutions, standards, and practices currently employed within the UK healthcare sector.
To develop a structured, actionable recommendation framework providing mitigation and resilience strategies against the identified risks.
To align the risk analysis, solution evaluation, and recommendations with the eight domains of the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) certification, providing a recognized structure for cybersecurity professionals.
To outline the concept for an actionable artefact (e.g., an interactive tool) that operationalizes the recommendation framework for practical use by healthcare cybersecurity practitioners.
1.4 Methodology
The findings and recommendations presented in this report are based on a comprehensive analysis of publicly available data, including regulatory documents (NIS2 Directive text, UK Government policy statements), threat intelligence reports from national cybersecurity agencies (NCSC, CISA) and industry experts, academic research papers focusing on healthcare cybersecurity, AI risks, and pandemic impacts, and industry best practice guidelines. This information has been synthesized to identify key risks, evaluate current controls, and formulate a cohesive risk model and recommendation framework.
1.5 Scope
The scope of this report is confined to the cybersecurity landscape of the UK healthcare sector, encompassing NHS organisations (Trusts, Integrated Care Boards), private providers interacting with NHS data or systems, and relevant entities within the healthcare supply chain (e.g., medical device manufacturers, software vendors, managed service providers). The analysis focuses specifically on the cybersecurity implications arising from three key external factors: the NIS2 Directive and the UK's legislative response, the lasting effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on cybersecurity posture, and the emerging challenges posed by Generative AI. All analysis and recommendations are structured and mapped against the eight domains of the CISSP Common Body of Knowledge.
2. Cyber Risk Landscape Analysis (Aligned with CISSP Domains)
The UK healthcare sector faces a dynamic and increasingly complex cyber risk landscape. While numerous threats exist, this analysis focuses on the specific challenges and vulnerabilities introduced or exacerbated by three major external drivers: the evolving regulatory environment shaped by the NIS2 Directive and the UK's Cyber Security and Resilience Bill; the enduring cybersecurity consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic; and the nascent but significant risks associated with Generative AI. Each factor presents unique challenges that require careful consideration within a comprehensive risk management strategy.
2.1 The NIS2 Directive and UK Cyber Security & Resilience Bill Context
2.1.1 Overview
The EU's Network and Information Systems 2 (NIS2) Directive (Directive (EU) 2022/2555), which Member States were required to transpose into national law by October 17, 2024 (NIS-2-Directive.com, n.d.), represents a significant overhaul of cybersecurity regulations for critical infrastructure across the Union (NIS-2-Directive.com, n.d.). Replacing the original 2016 NIS Directive, NIS2 aims to establish a higher common level of cybersecurity resilience (NIS-2-Directive.com, n.d.). Healthcare is explicitly designated as an 'essential' sector under NIS2 (NIS2Directive.eu, n.d.-a), subjecting it to the directive's most stringent requirements (NIS2Directive.eu, n.d.-a).
Key changes introduced by NIS2 include:
Broader Scope: Extending coverage to more sectors and entities, including various healthcare providers, manufacturers of medical devices and pharmaceuticals, and research bodies (Digital Strategy, n.d.).
Stricter Risk Management: Mandating comprehensive, proportionate technical, operational, and organizational measures based on an 'all-hazards' approach, covering areas like incident handling, business continuity, and cryptography (NIS-2-Directive.com, n.d.).
Enhanced Supply Chain Security: Explicitly requiring organisations to address cybersecurity risks within their supply chains, including relationships with direct suppliers and service providers (RSM UK, 2024).
Stringent Incident Reporting: Introducing a multi-stage reporting obligation for significant incidents: an 'early warning' within 24 hours, a notification within 72 hours, and a final report within one month (DLA Piper, 2024).
Management Liability: Holding senior management personally accountable for overseeing and approving cybersecurity risk management measures, with potential personal liability for infringements (AJG, 2024a).
Increased Sanctions: Empowering national authorities to impose significant administrative fines – up to €10 million or 2% of global annual turnover for essential entities, and €7 million or 1.4% for important entities (DLA Piper, 2024).
Stricter Supervision: Implementing enhanced supervisory measures, including regular and ad-hoc audits, particularly for essential entities (DLA Piper, 2024).
Following Brexit, the NIS2 Directive does not directly apply in the UK (Shoosmiths, 2024a). However, the UK government is updating its existing NIS Regulations 2018 (which implemented the original NIS Directive) through the proposed Cyber Security and Resilience Bill (UK Government, 2023a). This Bill aims to "address the specific cybersecurity challenges faced by the UK while aligning, where appropriate, with the approach taken in the EU NIS 2 directive" (UK Government, 2023a). Key proposals in the Bill mirror NIS2 concerns, including bringing Managed Service Providers (MSPs) into scope, strengthening supply chain security duties (including designating 'Critical Suppliers'), enhancing incident reporting, and empowering regulators (UK Government, 2023a). This creates a complex situation for UK healthcare organisations, particularly those operating in or supplying services to the EU, who may face dual compliance requirements (RSM UK, 2024).
2.1.2 Risk 1: Increased Compliance Burden & Potential for Misconfigurations
Description: The comprehensive and stringent requirements mandated by NIS2 and mirrored in the UK Bill impose a substantial compliance overhead on UK healthcare organisations (NIS2Directive.eu, n.d.-a). This includes implementing detailed risk management policies, establishing rapid incident reporting mechanisms, conducting thorough supply chain due diligence, ensuring management oversight, and preparing for potential audits (Grant Thornton, 2025). For a sector already facing significant resource constraints (NIS2Directive.eu, n.d.-a), meeting these demands presents a major challenge. The pressure to achieve compliance quickly, potentially without adequate expertise or budget, increases the risk of shortcuts, incomplete implementations, or misconfigured security controls, paradoxically weakening the organisation's security posture (RSM UK, 2024).
Vulnerabilities: Limited cybersecurity budgets and staffing within healthcare organisations (NIS2Directive.eu, n.d.-a); difficulty in recruiting and retaining skilled cybersecurity professionals (European Commission, 2025); complexity in mapping new regulatory requirements to existing controls and fragmented IT systems (NIS2Directive.eu, n.d.-a); challenges in updating or securing legacy technology prevalent in healthcare (NIS2Directive.eu, n.d.-a); ambiguity surrounding the final details and interpretation of the UK Bill (UK Government, 2023a); pressure to prioritise demonstrable compliance (paperwork) over operational security effectiveness (NCSC, 2023a).
Attacker Techniques: Scanning for and exploiting common misconfigurations in firewalls, cloud services, or access controls resulting from rushed implementations; targeting unpatched systems where resources have been diverted to compliance activities; leveraging gaps in understanding or implementation of new security tools mandated by the regulations.
Impact: Significant financial penalties for non-compliance under NIS2 or the UK Bill (DLA Piper, 2024); reputational damage following a compliance failure or related breach; increased exposure to cyberattacks due to poorly implemented or misconfigured controls; potential suspension of certifications or management functions for severe non-compliance (Shoosmiths, 2024a); disruption to healthcare services if compliance efforts detract from essential security maintenance.
CISSP Domain Alignment:
Security and Risk Management: Compliance Management, Legal and Regulatory Issues, Risk Management Frameworks, Security Policies and Procedures.
Security Assessment and Testing: Security Audits, Vulnerability Management, Security Control Testing.
Security Operations: Configuration Management, Change Management, Incident Management (Reporting).
Implications & Considerations: The drive for compliance under NIS2 and the UK Bill, while well-intentioned, carries a latent risk. If organisations prioritise ticking boxes and generating documentation over achieving genuine improvements in security posture, the compliance effort itself could divert critical resources – time, budget, personnel – away from essential operational tasks like patching, monitoring, and threat hunting (NCSC, 2023a). This potential resource drain, coupled with existing constraints in the healthcare sector (NIS2Directive.eu, n.d.-a), means that the compliance burden might inadvertently create new vulnerabilities or leave existing ones unaddressed. Furthermore, the UK's strategy of aligning "where appropriate" (UK Government, 2023a) introduces an element of uncertainty. Until the final UK regulations are fully clarified and interpreted, organisations, especially those with EU links facing dual requirements (Shoosmiths, 2024a), may struggle to accurately scope the necessary investments (NCC Group, n.d.). This ambiguity could lead to either inefficient overspending in an attempt to cover all bases or risky under-investment due to misjudging the required standard, ultimately hindering effective risk management (ISMS.online, 2024).
2.1.3 Risk 2: Heightened Supply Chain Scrutiny & Third-Party Risk
Description: Both NIS2 and the UK Bill place unprecedented emphasis on securing the supply chain (UK Government, 2023a). Healthcare organisations are heavily reliant on a complex ecosystem of third-party suppliers, including providers of clinical software, medical devices, IT infrastructure (including cloud services), managed services (MSPs), pathology labs, and administrative support (RSM UK, 2024). Each supplier represents a potential entry point for attackers. The regulations mandate that healthcare organisations actively assess and manage the cybersecurity risks associated with their suppliers, holding them accountable for the security posture of their entire value chain (Grant Thornton, 2025). Failures within the supply chain, as evidenced by incidents impacting NHS services due to compromised partners (RSM UK, 2024), can directly disrupt patient care and lead to significant data breaches (RSM UK, 2024). The UK Bill's provision for designating 'Critical Suppliers' further underscores this focus (UK Government, 2023a).
Vulnerabilities: Limited visibility into the security practices and controls of third- and fourth-party suppliers (Supply Chain Digital, 2024); inadequate security requirements or audit rights within supplier contracts; over-reliance on supplier self-attestations or certifications without independent verification; vulnerabilities within interconnected systems linking healthcare providers and suppliers (NIS2Directive.eu, n.d.-a); insecure remote access granted to MSPs or support vendors (NatLawReview, 2025); compromise of software updates or hardware components before delivery.
Attacker Techniques: Targeting less secure suppliers as an indirect route into the main healthcare network (supply chain attack) (RSM UK, 2024); exploiting known vulnerabilities in widely used third-party software or medical devices; compromising MSPs to leverage their privileged access across multiple healthcare clients; injecting malware into the supply chain (e.g., SolarWinds-style attacks) (Risk Ledger, 2023).
Impact: Disruption of critical healthcare services due to supplier outages or compromises (e.g., cancelled appointments/surgeries) (RSM UK, 2024); breach of sensitive patient data originating from a compromised supplier (RSM UK, 2024); regulatory non-compliance and fines stemming from supplier security failures (Navex, 2024); significant reputational damage affecting both the supplier and the healthcare organisation; loss of intellectual property (e.g., research data) via compromised partners.
CISSP Domain Alignment:
Security and Risk Management: Third-Party Risk Management, Supply Chain Risk Management, Compliance.
Asset Security: Information Lifecycle Management (Data Handling by Suppliers), Supply Chain Security.
Security Architecture and Engineering: Secure System Integration, Secure Cloud Computing (for SaaS/IaaS suppliers).
Identity and Access Management: Third-Party Access Management, Federated Identity (if applicable).
Security Assessment and Testing: Supplier Security Audits, Vulnerability Assessments of Integrated Systems.
Software Development Security: Security of Acquired Software/Components.
Implications & Considerations: The UK Bill's mechanism for designating 'Critical Suppliers' (UK Government, 2023a), while intended to focus regulatory attention on high-impact vendors, could inadvertently create a tiered risk landscape. Healthcare organisations, faced with limited resources for supplier assurance, might concentrate their efforts on these designated critical suppliers. Consequently, non-designated suppliers, potentially perceived as lower risk or subject to less stringent oversight, might invest less in their own security. This could make them more attractive targets for adversaries seeking an easier entry point into the healthcare ecosystem. Furthermore, the regulatory shift making healthcare organisations explicitly responsible for ensuring the security of their suppliers (Grant Thornton, 2025) necessitates a fundamental change in procurement and vendor management practices. Simple contractual clauses or reliance on basic certifications may no longer suffice. Deeper technical due diligence, including security assessments, penetration testing evidence, and potentially continuous monitoring of supplier environments, will likely be required (Risk Ledger, 2023). This increased scrutiny will inevitably add complexity, cost, and time to procurement cycles, potentially requiring significant updates to existing NHS procurement frameworks like those managed by NHS SBS or CCS, which traditionally may have prioritised cost and functionality over in-depth security validation (Thornton and Lowe, 2023a).
2.2 The Lingering Impact of COVID-19
2.2.1 Overview
The COVID-19 pandemic acted as a catalyst for unprecedented and rapid digital transformation within the UK healthcare sector. The urgent need to maintain services while minimising physical contact led to the accelerated adoption of remote working for staff, widespread implementation of telehealth consultations, and increased reliance on digital communication channels (PMC, 2022a). This shift, often executed under immense pressure, prioritised speed and accessibility, sometimes at the expense of robust cybersecurity considerations (CrowdStrike, 2020). Consequently, vulnerabilities introduced during this period may persist. Simultaneously, the pandemic created a fertile ground for cybercriminals and other malicious actors, who exploited the global crisis, public fear, and disruption to launch targeted attacks (Allam et al., 2022). Healthcare organisations, vaccine research institutions, and the associated supply chains became prime targets (Allam et al., 2022). In response, NHS Digital and the NCSC rolled out enhanced support services, threat intelligence sharing, and protective measures like PDNS (Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, 2020).
2.2.2 Risk 1: Exploitation of Expanded Remote/Hybrid Working Models
Description: The necessary shift to remote working and telehealth during the pandemic significantly expanded the traditional attack surface of healthcare organisations (PMC, 2022a). Staff accessed sensitive patient data and clinical systems from geographically dispersed locations, often using networks and devices outside the direct control of organisational IT security (Health Catalyst, 2020). While some staff may have returned to on-site working, hybrid models persist, meaning these remote access pathways and the associated vulnerabilities remain relevant targets for attackers (ResearchGate, 2021a). Remote access technologies like VPNs and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), essential for remote connectivity, continue to be actively exploited if not properly configured and secured (PMC, 2022a).
Vulnerabilities: Use of insecure or poorly configured home Wi-Fi networks by staff (Health Catalyst, 2020); connection via personal devices (Bring Your Own Device - BYOD) lacking organisational security controls (patching, endpoint protection, configuration management) (PMC, 2022a); unpatched vulnerabilities in VPN clients or servers (PMC, 2022a); exposed or weakly secured RDP endpoints; insufficient endpoint visibility and management capabilities for remote devices (National Health Executive, 2020); challenges with secure remote password management and enforcing security hygiene practices (e.g., timely password changes) for a dispersed workforce (National Health Executive, 2020).
Attacker Techniques: Scanning for and exploiting known VPN vulnerabilities; conducting brute-force or credential-stuffing attacks against RDP or VPN logins; compromising insecure home routers or personal devices used for work to gain initial access; targeted phishing attacks aimed at stealing remote access credentials (National Health Executive, 2020).
Impact: Unauthorised access to sensitive electronic health records (EHRs) and critical clinical systems via compromised remote connections; deployment of ransomware that spreads from an infected remote endpoint into the core healthcare network; disruption of telehealth services through attacks on the platform or connected devices; data breaches resulting from insecure data handling or storage on remote devices (Health Catalyst, 2020).
CISSP Domain Alignment:
Security Architecture and Engineering: Network Security Design (Segmentation), Secure Remote Access Solutions (VPNs, VDI).
Communication and Network Security: Network Protocols (RDP), Wireless Security, VPN Security.
Identity and Access Management: Authentication Mechanisms (MFA), Remote Access Control Policies.
Asset Security: Endpoint Security (Patching, Antivirus, EDR), Mobile Device Security, BYOD Policies.
Security Operations: Remote Monitoring, Incident Response for Remote Endpoints.
Implications & Considerations: The rapid, crisis-driven adoption of remote working technologies meant that security controls were often implemented reactively or as temporary workarounds (CrowdStrike, 2020). However, with hybrid working becoming a persistent feature for many healthcare roles (ResearchGate, 2021a), these 'temporary' measures may have become embedded operational realities (Health Catalyst, 2020). Relaxed VPN access policies, incomplete BYOD management solutions, or reliance on user self-management for home network security, initially accepted due to the emergency, now represent systemic weaknesses in the organisation's security posture (National Health Executive, 2020). Reverting fully to a pre-pandemic, perimeter-centric model is often impractical, demanding a sustained focus on securing this distributed environment. Furthermore, the rise of telehealth introduces a novel challenge: managing risks originating from the patient's end (PMC, 2022a). Healthcare providers have limited or no control over the security of patients' home networks or personal devices used for virtual consultations (AHA, 2020). A compromised patient device could potentially be used to eavesdrop on sessions or even launch attacks against the telehealth platform itself, effectively extending the provider's risk boundary into numerous uncontrolled environments.
2.2.3 Risk 2: Increased Sophistication of Phishing & Social Engineering Targeting Health Information
Description: The COVID-19 pandemic triggered an explosion in phishing and social engineering campaigns that preyed on public fear, uncertainty, and the urgent need for information (Allam et al., 2022). Attackers crafted convincing lures related to virus updates, testing, vaccines, financial support, remote working policies, and PPE, often impersonating trusted authorities like the World Health Organization (WHO), NHS, government departments, or even internal IT/HR teams (Allam et al., 2022). While the specific COVID-19 themes may have subsided, the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) honed during this period persist. Attackers continue to leverage social engineering, exploiting human psychology (urgency, authority, emotion) (HHS.gov, 2023) to target valuable healthcare data (patient records, research IP) and gain access to systems (Okta UK, n.d.). The high value of health data makes the sector a continuous target (Kumar and Singh, 2024).
Vulnerabilities: Heightened stress and fatigue among healthcare staff, potentially reducing vigilance (Digital Health, 2025a); information overload from numerous legitimate communications, making malicious messages harder to spot; inadequate or infrequent security awareness training, or training that fails to translate into consistent secure behaviour (Digital Health, 2025a); inherent human trust in perceived authority or familiar branding (HHS.gov, 2023); technical gaps in email filtering or endpoint protection allowing malicious content through.
Attacker Techniques: Highly targeted spear-phishing emails aimed at specific individuals or roles (e.g., finance, HR, clinicians with system access); SMS-based phishing (smishing) campaigns (HHS.gov, 2023); voice-based phishing (vishing) using phone calls (Skills for Health, 2023); Business Email Compromise (BEC) involving impersonation of senior staff or suppliers to authorise fraudulent transactions or data release (LORCA, 2020); use of lures related to mandatory training, system updates, appointment confirmations, research collaborations, or urgent requests.
Impact: Theft of user credentials (usernames, passwords) leading to unauthorised account access; deployment of malware, including ransomware, through malicious email attachments or links (ResearchOnline LSHTM, 2021); financial losses due to fraudulent payment instructions or BEC scams (HHS.gov, 2023); breach and exposure of sensitive patient data or confidential organisational information (Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, 2020); disruption of services if key accounts are compromised.
CISSP Domain Alignment:
Security Operations: Incident Detection (Phishing), Incident Response.
Security and Risk Management: Security Awareness and Training, Risk Management.
Identity and Access Management: Credential Management, Authentication.
Communication and Network Security: Email Security, Network Security (Filtering).
Implications & Considerations: The pandemic fundamentally altered communication patterns, normalising the receipt of urgent, often unexpected messages via multiple channels (email, SMS) from various official sources (Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, 2020). This conditioning may have inadvertently lowered the guard of staff, making them more susceptible to phishing attacks that mimic these urgent, authoritative communication styles. The learned behaviour of reacting quickly to perceived critical updates can override security training principles, increasing the likelihood of clicking malicious links or opening harmful attachments. Furthermore, the intense focus of cyberattacks on vaccine development, research institutions, and the medical supply chain during the pandemic (Allam et al., 2022) signals a strategic interest, particularly from state-sponsored actors (Allam et al., 2022), extending beyond traditional targets like hospital patient records. These adversaries demonstrated motivations encompassing espionage (stealing intellectual property) and disruption of critical national capabilities, not just immediate financial gain. This broadens the definition of critical assets within the healthcare ecosystem that require robust protection, including research data, manufacturing processes, and logistics information.
2.3 The Emergence of Generative AI
2.3.1 Overview
Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), encompassing technologies like Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of producing text, code, and conversation, and tools that generate realistic images, audio, and video (NCSC, 2024a), presents both transformative opportunities and significant new cybersecurity risks for the healthcare sector (Madgwick, 2024). While AI holds potential for improving diagnostics, streamlining administration, and accelerating research (Madgwick, 2024), its capabilities can also be weaponized by malicious actors, and the AI systems themselves introduce novel vulnerabilities (MIAA, 2024). National bodies like the NCSC are actively researching and providing guidance on these risks (NCSC, 2024a). UK government policy is also evolving, with the establishment of the AI Security Institute (formerly AI Safety Institute) to focus on serious AI risks with security implications (GOV.UK, n.d.-a), and the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) issuing guidance on data protection considerations for GenAI, particularly concerning training data, accuracy, and transparency (Osborne Clarke, 2025a). The risks manifest in two primary ways: AI enhancing existing cyber threats and the emergence of new attack vectors targeting the AI models themselves.
2.3.2 Risk 1: AI-Powered Social Engineering & Deepfake Threats
Description: GenAI tools dramatically lower the cost and skill required to create highly convincing and personalized social engineering attacks at scale (NCSC, 2024b). This includes crafting sophisticated phishing emails that evade traditional filters, generating tailored pretexting scenarios, and producing realistic deepfake audio and video content (MIAA, 2024). For healthcare, this means staff and patients face increasingly deceptive communications. Deepfakes pose a particular threat, potentially being used to impersonate executives, clinicians, or patients in voice calls or video conferences (including telehealth sessions), bypass biometric authentication systems, or spread medical misinformation (Gen Re, 2025).
Vulnerabilities: The inherent difficulty for humans in distinguishing high-quality AI-generated fakes from reality (Gen Re, 2025); limitations of existing security tools (e.g., email filters) in detecting AI-generated malicious content; potential weaknesses in voice or facial biometric authentication systems against sophisticated deepfakes (Verdict, 2024); the trust implicitly placed in voice and video communication channels (Gen Re, 2025); lack of widespread deployment of effective deepfake detection technologies.
Attacker Techniques: Mass generation of highly personalized spear-phishing emails using LLMs; creating deepfake voice clones of executives or finance staff to authorize fraudulent wire transfers or request sensitive data (Gen Re, 2025); using deepfake video avatars in virtual meetings or telehealth calls to impersonate individuals for fraud or information gathering (Gen Re, 2025); generating fake expert endorsements or patient testimonials to promote fraudulent treatments or spread health misinformation (DHInsights, 2024); automating social engineering interactions using AI chatbots (Washington State University, n.d.).
Impact: Significantly increased success rates for phishing and social engineering attacks leading to credential theft, malware infections, and data breaches; substantial financial losses from deepfake-enabled fraud (e.g., CEO fraud, invoice redirection) (Gen Re, 2025); unauthorized access to systems or sensitive information through successful impersonation; erosion of trust in digital communication channels, telemedicine platforms, and potentially healthcare professionals themselves (DHInsights, 2024); reputational damage to individuals or organisations targeted by defamatory deepfakes (DHInsights, 2024).
CISSP Domain Alignment:
Security Operations: Incident Detection, Security Monitoring.
Security and Risk Management: Security Awareness and Training, Risk Management.
Identity and Access Management: Authentication Methods, Identity Verification.
Communication and Network Security: Email Security, Voice and Video Security.
Implications & Considerations: The advent of convincing deepfakes poses a fundamental challenge to established identity verification practices in healthcare. Traditional methods, including knowledge-based questions, static biometrics (voiceprints, facial recognition), and even some forms of multi-factor authentication (MFA) involving voice or video confirmation, become vulnerable to spoofing (Verdict, 2024). This necessitates a shift towards more robust techniques, such as incorporating sophisticated liveness detection into biometric systems to differentiate between a real person and a synthetic representation, or potentially moving towards continuous authentication models that monitor user behaviour over time rather than relying on single point-in-time checks. Additionally, GenAI introduces a unique risk through its propensity to "hallucinate" – generating outputs that sound plausible but are factually incorrect or nonsensical (NCSC, 2024a). In a healthcare context, where AI might be used for clinical documentation, research summarization, or even as part of decision support tools (Madgwick, 2024), reliance on such inaccurate information without rigorous human validation could lead to misdiagnosis, inappropriate treatment decisions, or the propagation of medical misinformation (DHInsights, 2024). This risk blurs the line between a cybersecurity concern (data integrity, misinformation) and a direct clinical safety issue, demanding careful governance and mandatory human oversight in critical applications (MIAA, 2024).
2.3.3 Risk 2: Data Poisoning & Integrity Risks for Healthcare AI Models
Description: The effectiveness and safety of AI models used in healthcare (e.g., for diagnostic image analysis, predicting patient risk, treatment recommendation, drug discovery) depend critically on the integrity of their training data (arXiv, 2025a). Data poisoning attacks involve malicious actors deliberately corrupting this training data to manipulate the model's behaviour (MIAA, 2024). This could involve introducing biases to cause discriminatory outcomes, creating hidden backdoors that cause the model to misbehave under specific conditions (e.g., when encountering a specific trigger word or image pattern), or simply degrading the model's overall accuracy and reliability (CEUR-WS.org, 2024). Such attacks undermine the trustworthiness and safety of AI in clinical settings. Furthermore, adversarial attacks, which involve making subtle, often imperceptible changes to the input data at the time of inference, can also trick AI models into making incorrect classifications or predictions (Washington State University, n.d.).
Vulnerabilities: Heavy reliance of deep learning models on vast amounts of training data, often sourced from diverse and potentially unverified origins (including web scraping) (NCSC, 2024a); the inherent complexity and 'black box' nature of some AI models, making it difficult to detect subtle data manipulations or understand their impact (Washington State University, n.d.); inadequate data validation, sanitation, and provenance tracking in AI development pipelines (Perception Point, n.d.); vulnerabilities specific to distributed or federated learning approaches where multiple parties contribute data (arXiv, 2025a); the difficulty of detecting 'clean-label' poisoning attacks where the malicious data itself doesn't appear anomalous (arXiv, 2025a).
Attacker Techniques: Injecting data with incorrect labels (label flipping) (arXiv, 2025a); adding carefully crafted malicious data points to the training set (data injection, backdoor poisoning) (CEUR-WS.org, 2024); subtly altering existing training data features without changing labels (input modification/clean-label attacks) (arXiv, 2025a); manipulating the semantic relationships within data (semantic poisoning) (CEUR-WS.org, 2024); modifying input data during inference to cause misclassification (adversarial examples) (Washington State University, n.d.). A specific healthcare example involves poisoning a clinical LLM's training data to make it recommend an incorrect or harmful medication when triggered by certain patient query patterns (medRxiv, 2024).
Impact: Incorrect AI-assisted medical diagnoses leading to delayed or improper treatment; flawed treatment recommendations generated by compromised clinical decision support systems; biased allocation of healthcare resources or biased risk predictions due to poisoned models; complete erosion of clinical trust in AI tools, hindering adoption of beneficial technologies; potential for widespread patient harm if widely used foundational models or datasets are successfully poisoned (CEUR-WS.org, 2024); failure of AI-driven security tools due to poisoning.
CISSP Domain Alignment:
Software Development Security: Secure AI/ML Development Lifecycle, Data Validation, Model Testing.
Asset Security: Data Integrity, Information Classification, Data Governance.
Security and Risk Management: Risk Assessment, Data Quality Management.
Security Assessment and Testing: Model Validation and Verification, Security Audits of AI Systems.
Implications & Considerations: Data poisoning attacks represent a fundamental challenge to the integrity and trustworthiness of AI systems, particularly in high-stakes domains like healthcare (NIST, 2025). While traditional cybersecurity often prioritises confidentiality (preventing data theft) and availability (ensuring system uptime), data poisoning targets the core logic and reliability of the AI model itself. A poisoned AI might remain available and its data confidential, yet produce dangerously incorrect or biased outputs. Detecting and mitigating these attacks requires specialized techniques beyond standard network or endpoint security, such as robust data validation, anomaly detection in training data, adversarial training, and model monitoring (Perception Point, n.d.). Furthermore, the increasing use of third-party datasets, pre-trained models, and AI-as-a-Service platforms in healthcare introduces significant supply chain risks related to data poisoning (arXiv, 2025b). Healthcare organisations deploying these external AI components may have little visibility or control over the original training data's provenance and integrity (OAIC, n.d.). A vulnerability or poisoning attack introduced during the vendor's development process becomes an inherited risk for the healthcare organisation, making thorough vendor due diligence and ongoing model validation critical, yet challenging.

3. Analysis of Existing UK Healthcare Cybersecurity Solutions (Aligned with CISSP Domains)
3.1 Overview of Current Ecosystem
The UK healthcare sector employs a range of frameworks, technologies, and practices to manage cybersecurity risks, driven by regulatory requirements, national guidance, and organisational initiatives. Key components include:
Frameworks & Standards:
NHS Data Security and Protection Toolkit (DSPT): A mandatory online self-assessment tool for organisations accessing NHS patient data or systems. It measures performance against the National Data Guardian's 10 data security standards and helps demonstrate compliance with data protection law (DPO Centre, 2023). It covers areas like data protection, cybersecurity, and incident management (Policy Pros, n.d.).
NCSC Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF): Increasingly being adopted as the basis for cybersecurity assurance within the DSPT, especially for higher-risk Category 1 organisations (CrowdStrike, 2023). The CAF provides a structured, outcome-focused approach based on four objectives: Managing Security Risk, Protecting Against Cyber Attacks, Detecting Cyber Security Events, and Minimising Impact (NCSC, 2023a). It is designed for critical national infrastructure and organisations managing risks to public safety (NCSC, 2023a).
Other Frameworks: ISO 27001 is often used or required, particularly for suppliers, as evidence of an Information Security Management System (ISMS) (NHS England, 2023a). The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is also referenced and provides a flexible approach to risk management (Digital Marketplace, 2024a).
Technologies:
Endpoint Security: Widespread deployment includes traditional antivirus and increasingly, Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions (Trend Micro, n.d.). NHS Digital facilitated the rollout of Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) across NHS devices (GOV.UK, 2019).
Network Security: Standard controls like firewalls are common (Policy Pros, n.d.). NHS England offers services like NHS Secure Boundary (a perimeter security solution) (NHS England Digital, n.d.-a) and Protective DNS (PDNS) to block access to malicious domains (NCSC, 2021). There is growing interest and some adoption of Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) principles, including network segmentation (Smith, 2023a).
Monitoring & Detection: Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems are used for log aggregation and analysis (Trend Micro, n.d.). The national NHS Cyber Security Operations Centre (CSOC) provides threat monitoring, intelligence, threat hunting, and incident response support (NHS England Digital, n.d.-a). Vulnerability scanning services are also utilized (Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, 2020).
Data Protection: Measures include encryption (Policy Pros, n.d.) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) (IMS Nucleii, 2024).
Medical Device Security: The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) regulates medical devices in the UK, including requirements for post-market surveillance (PMS) to monitor safety and performance (Digital Health, 2025b). NHS guidance exists for the clinical risk management of health IT systems, including connected medical devices (CMDs), covering deployment, maintenance, and decommissioning (e.g., DCB0129 for manufacturers, DCB0160 for deployers) (NHS England, n.d.-a). The Digital Technology Assessment Criteria (DTAC) is used to evaluate digital tools, including apps, covering clinical safety, data protection, technical security, interoperability, and usability (Bedfordshire, Luton and Milton Keynes ICB, n.d.).
Supply Chain Management: Procurement often occurs through established NHS Commercial frameworks (e.g., managed by NHS Shared Business Services (SBS) or Crown Commercial Service (CCS)) (Thornton and Lowe, 2023a). NHS England provides strategic direction and guidance on recommended frameworks (NHS England, n.d.-b). There is an increasing emphasis on supplier cybersecurity assurance, with requirements often including certifications like Cyber Essentials or ISO 27001 (Thornton and Lowe, 2023a). Tools like Risk Ledger have been used (e.g., by NHS Test and Trace) to gain better supply chain visibility (Risk Ledger, n.d.).
Training & Awareness: NHS England and partners offer various training resources. This includes NCSC-assured training for boards and Senior Information Risk Owners (SIROs), general data security awareness modules (Levels 1-3), access to platforms like Immersive Labs for skills development, and simulated phishing exercises (GOV.UK, 2019). The Cyber Associates Network (CAN) facilitates knowledge sharing (NHS England Digital, n.d.-b).
3.2 Critical Evaluation of Existing Solutions
While the UK healthcare sector has implemented numerous cybersecurity measures, their effectiveness faces challenges, particularly in light of the risks posed by NIS2/UK Bill, COVID-19 legacy, and GenAI.
Strengths:
Standardization Efforts: The DSPT provides a baseline level of assurance across organisations handling NHS data, and the move towards CAF alignment signifies a push for greater maturity and consistency (CrowdStrike, 2023).
Centralized Support: National bodies like NHS England/Digital and the NCSC provide valuable resources, guidance, shared services (CSOC, PDNS), threat intelligence, and some funding streams, reducing the burden on individual trusts (NHS England Digital, 2020a).
Growing Technology Adoption: There is evidence of adoption of modern security technologies like EDR and SIEM, and exploration of advanced concepts like ZTA, indicating progress beyond basic perimeter defences (Smith, 2023a).
Focus on Training: The availability of dedicated training programs for different roles, from board members to general staff, shows recognition of the importance of the human element (Digital Marketplace, 2024a).
Weaknesses & Limitations:
DSPT/CAF Implementation Challenges: The DSPT, being a self-assessment, is often perceived and treated as a 'tick-box' exercise, potentially lacking depth and rigour (DPO Centre, 2023). While independent audits are being introduced for CAF-aligned assessments (DPO Centre, 2023), concerns exist about the validity and consistency of assessments, especially when relying on self-reported evidence (Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital, 2024). Implementing the more demanding CAF framework is resource-intensive (time, cost, expertise) and complex, particularly for organisations with diverse IT environments, significant legacy systems, and limited cybersecurity staffing (CrowdStrike, 2023). There's a risk that organisations may focus on achieving compliance indicators that are easiest to meet, rather than addressing the highest actual risks (NCSC, 2023a). Furthermore, the sensitivity of audit findings means organisations may be reluctant to disclose details publicly, potentially hindering transparency and shared learning (Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital, 2024).
Technology Gaps & Fatigue: The effectiveness of EDR and SIEM tools is often hampered by a shortage of skilled analysts to manage them, configure detection rules appropriately, and investigate alerts (NCC Group, 2023a). High volumes of alerts, many of which are false positives, lead to 'alert fatigue', where genuine threats may be missed by overwhelmed security teams (Forenova, 2024). EDR solutions provide endpoint visibility but miss threats originating or moving across the network or in the cloud (NCC Group, 2023a). The prevalence of legacy systems and outdated technology in parts of the NHS (NIS2Directive.eu, n.d.-a) makes it difficult or impossible to deploy modern security solutions like comprehensive EDR or implement ZTA principles effectively (MDPI, 2021).
Supply Chain Assurance Gaps: Traditional NHS procurement frameworks have often prioritised cost and functionality over in-depth cybersecurity assurance (Thornton and Lowe, 2023a). Assessing and managing risk across complex, multi-tiered supply chains remains a significant challenge, with many organisations admitting poor visibility beyond their direct suppliers (Supply Chain Digital, 2024). Ensuring that all suppliers, especially smaller ones or those further down the chain, meet the stringent security requirements potentially mandated by NIS2/UK Bill is a major hurdle (Risk Ledger, 2023). Real-world incidents involving critical NHS supply chain systems like RESUS demonstrate existing vulnerabilities (PYMNTS.com, 2025).
Training Effectiveness & Culture: Despite the availability of training programs, surveys indicate that a significant proportion of NHS staff feel they lack regular or sufficient cybersecurity training (Digital Health, 2025a). Furthermore, measuring the effectiveness of awareness training in terms of actual behavioural change and risk reduction is notoriously difficult (Digital Health, 2025a). Moving beyond basic awareness to embed a deeply ingrained, proactive security culture across large, diverse healthcare workforces remains an ongoing challenge (Smith, 2023a).
Medical Device Security: Securing the vast array of connected medical devices (IoMT) presents unique difficulties. These devices often have long operational lifecycles, may run on outdated operating systems, and cannot always be easily patched or updated due to clinical validation requirements or vendor restrictions (Allam et al., 2022). While standards like DTAC provide pre-procurement assessment criteria (NHS England, n.d.-a), the ongoing secure management, monitoring, and timely decommissioning of these devices throughout their lifecycle is complex.
AI Threat Preparedness: Current cybersecurity postures are largely reactive and may be ill-equipped to handle the novel threats posed by GenAI (ResearchGate, n.d.). Traditional signature-based or rule-based detection methods may struggle to identify sophisticated AI-generated phishing or deepfake content. Detecting data poisoning attacks requires specialized techniques focused on data integrity and model behaviour analysis, which are not standard components of most current security toolsets. The lack of transparency into the training data and internal workings of many commercial AI models further complicates risk assessment and mitigation (Osborne Clarke, 2025b).
CISSP Domain Coverage: The current ecosystem provides reasonable coverage for foundational aspects of Security and Risk Management (through DSPT/CAF compliance activities) and Security Operations (through CSOC, SIEM/EDR). However, significant gaps or inconsistencies likely exist in:
Security Architecture and Engineering: Particularly in implementing advanced concepts like ZTA comprehensively and securing legacy systems.
Asset Security: Especially concerning the full lifecycle management and security of IoMT and robust supply chain risk management beyond Tier 1.
Software Development Security: Often overlooked unless developing in-house clinical systems, and particularly immature regarding AI/ML security practices.
Identity and Access Management: While MFA is being adopted, consistent application across all access points (including remote, third-party, device) and robust identity verification against deepfakes remain challenges.
Security Assessment and Testing: While vulnerability scanning exists, deep technical assessments of suppliers, IoMT, and AI systems may be lacking.
Communication and Network Security: Securing diverse communication channels (email, voice, video, telehealth platforms) against sophisticated social engineering and deepfakes needs strengthening.
Implications & Considerations: The transition from the DSPT to the more rigorous, CAF-aligned assurance model (CrowdStrike, 2023) is a positive step towards improving cybersecurity maturity. However, it risks creating a disparity within the NHS ecosystem. Larger, better-resourced organisations (initially Category 1) may successfully adopt CAF, while smaller trusts, primary care providers, or social care partners might struggle due to resource and expertise constraints (Armis, n.d.). This potential 'two-tier' system could weaken overall resilience, as security is often only as strong as the weakest link in an interconnected system where data is shared (NHS Transformation Directorate, n.d.). Additionally, despite significant investment in sophisticated tools like EDR and SIEM (Trend Micro, n.d.), the persistent problem of 'alert fatigue' (Forenova, 2024) indicates that technology alone is insufficient. Without adequate skilled personnel to manage these tools, better integration between systems, increased automation (e.g., Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response - SOAR) (iboss, n.d.-a), and potentially leveraging AI itself for security operations (MIAA, 2024), the value derived from these investments may be limited in resource-constrained NHS environments. Finally, the predominant focus on technical controls (firewalls, EDR) and compliance frameworks (DSPT/CAF) (NHS Transformation Directorate, n.d.) might overshadow the critical importance of the human element and integrated security processes. While basic awareness training exists (Digital Health, 2025a), true resilience against threats like advanced social engineering, insider risk, or ensuring the safe deployment of AI requires more than just technology and compliance checklists. It demands a deep-rooted security culture, robust processes integrated into workflows (e.g., secure procurement, DevSecOps), and continuous reinforcement of secure behaviours, areas where the current approach may be underdeveloped (Smith, 2023a).

4. Cybersecurity Recommendation Framework
4.1 Framework Introduction & Structure
This Recommendation Framework provides a structured and actionable approach for UK healthcare organisations to enhance their cybersecurity posture and resilience. It directly addresses the specific risks identified in Section 2, stemming from the NIS2 Directive/UK Cyber Security & Resilience Bill, the legacy of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the emergence of Generative AI.
The framework links these Threat Drivers to the Specific Risks they create or exacerbate. For each risk, it proposes Recommended Control Categories and Actionable Recommendations designed to mitigate those risks. Each recommendation is mapped to the relevant CISSP Domain(s) to align with professional standards and facilitate integration into existing security programs. The framework advocates for a risk-based approach, enabling organisations to prioritise actions based on their specific context, threat landscape, and resource availability.
4.2 Actionable Recommendations (Organized by Control Category & Mapped to CISSP)
A. Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC)
(CISSP: Security and Risk Management)
Recommendation A1: Adopt Outcome-Focused Assurance (CAF Principles)
Action: Transition from compliance-centric self-assessments (like the traditional DSPT approach) towards the outcome-focused principles of the NCSC Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF). Ensure assessments are rigorous, evidence-based, and independently validated or audited where required (particularly for Category 1 organisations and those seeking higher assurance) (CrowdStrike, 2023).
Rationale: Addresses the limitations of 'tick-box' compliance (DPO Centre, 2023) and aligns with the strategic direction of NHS England (CrowdStrike, 2023) towards a more mature, risk-based assurance model capable of addressing complex threats.
Risk Addressed: Increased Compliance Burden & Potential for Misconfigurations (NIS2/UK Bill); Limitations of DSPT.
Recommendation A2: Strengthen Board-Level Accountability & Oversight
Action: Formally assign cybersecurity responsibility at the board level. Ensure executives and board members receive appropriate cybersecurity training (as mandated by NIS2 for management (Navex, 2024)) focused on strategic risk, regulatory obligations (including potential personal liability under NIS2/UK Bill (AJG, 2024a)), and oversight responsibilities (Digital Marketplace, 2024a). Integrate cybersecurity risk into regular board reporting and decision-making.
Rationale: Directly addresses the management liability components of NIS2/UK Bill and ensures cybersecurity is treated as a strategic business risk, not just an IT issue. Essential for driving security culture and securing resources.
Risk Addressed: Increased Compliance Burden (NIS2/UK Bill); Insufficient Resources; Lack of Security Culture.
Recommendation A3: Implement Integrated Risk Management
Action: Develop and maintain a dynamic, integrated risk management process that explicitly incorporates threats and vulnerabilities arising from NIS2/UK Bill compliance pressures, COVID-19 legacy issues (e.g., persistent remote work vulnerabilities, heightened phishing susceptibility), and emerging GenAI risks (e.g., deepfakes, data poisoning, model integrity). This process must extend across the entire organisation and encompass the full supply chain (MIAA, 2024).
Rationale: Moves beyond siloed risk assessments to provide a holistic view of the threat landscape, enabling better prioritisation and resource allocation. Essential for managing interconnected risks.
Risk Addressed: All identified risks across NIS2/UK Bill, COVID-19, and GenAI categories.
Recommendation A4: Proactively Manage AI Data Privacy & Ethics
Action: Establish clear governance for the development and deployment of AI systems. Conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) for all AI projects handling personal data (Simmons & Simmons, 2025). Carefully assess the lawful basis for processing training data, particularly if using web-scraped data, addressing the challenges highlighted by the ICO regarding legitimate interests (Osborne Clarke, 2025a). Ensure transparency regarding data use and model limitations (including accuracy/hallucinations (ICO, 2025a)). Implement mechanisms to facilitate individual rights (access, rectification, erasure) in relation to AI-processed data (Osborne Clarke, 2025a).
Rationale: Addresses the specific data protection and ethical risks associated with GenAI, navigating regulatory uncertainty and building public trust, which is crucial for AI adoption in healthcare (White & Case LLP, 2025).
Risk Addressed: Data Poisoning & Integrity Risks (GenAI); AI-Powered Social Engineering (Misinformation/Hallucination aspect); Compliance Burden (Data Protection).
B. Security Architecture & Engineering
(CISSP: Security Architecture and Engineering, Communication and Network Security)
Recommendation B1: Accelerate Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) Adoption
Action: Strategically plan and implement ZTA principles, prioritising critical systems and user groups. Focus on strong identity verification (universal MFA), least privilege access controls, and micro-segmentation to limit lateral movement within the network. Apply ZTA rigorously to remote access scenarios (Smith, 2023a).
Rationale: Directly mitigates risks associated with the dissolved network perimeter due to remote/hybrid work (AgileBlue, n.d.) and contains the impact of breaches by preventing attackers from easily moving across the network, including ransomware propagation (Smith, 2023a). Addresses known ZTA implementation challenges like legacy system compatibility by advocating a phased approach (MDPI, 2021).
Risk Addressed: Exploitation of Remote/Hybrid Working (COVID-19); Ransomware propagation; Insider Threats.
Recommendation B2: Harden Remote Working Security
Action: Implement and enforce strict security policies for all remote access. Mandate the use of MFA for VPN, RDP, and cloud service access. Where BYOD is permitted, enforce minimum security standards (patching, endpoint protection) using Mobile Device Management (MDM) or similar technologies (CrowdStrike, 2020). Provide guidance and potentially tools for securing home Wi-Fi networks (Health Catalyst, 2020). Segment network access for remote users based on role requirements (least privilege). Consider technologies like secure Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) or remote browser isolation for accessing highly sensitive systems (PMC, 2022a).
Rationale: Addresses the persistent vulnerabilities created by the rapid shift to remote work during COVID-19, reducing the attack surface associated with insecure endpoints and networks.
Risk Addressed: Exploitation of Remote/Hybrid Working (COVID-19).
Recommendation B3: Enhance Connected Medical Device (IoMT) Security
Action: Develop a comprehensive IoMT security program. Implement network segmentation to isolate medical devices from general IT networks and from each other where appropriate (Claroty, n.d.). Establish a robust process for vulnerability management and patching, working closely with device manufacturers and adhering to clinical risk management processes (DCB0160) (NHS England, n.d.-a). Enforce secure configuration standards for all deployed devices. Ensure procurement processes incorporate DTAC technical security criteria and MHRA guidance (Bedfordshire, Luton and Milton Keynes ICB, n.d.). Plan for secure decommissioning and data wiping (GOV.UK, 2021a).
Rationale: Addresses the unique and complex security challenges posed by the proliferation of connected devices in clinical environments, which are often targeted by attackers and difficult to secure using traditional IT methods.
Risk Addressed: IoMT vulnerabilities; Ransomware targeting medical devices; Patient safety impacts from device compromise.
Recommendation B4: Architect for AI Threat Resilience
Action: When designing or deploying systems incorporating AI, build in resilience against AI-specific threats. Implement robust input validation and sanitisation techniques to defend against prompt injection attacks targeting LLMs (NCSC, 2024a). Explore and evaluate emerging deepfake detection technologies for communication channels (voice, video) where feasible (DHInsights, 2024). Investigate methods for ensuring AI model provenance and integrity, such as digital watermarking or robust auditing trails (Perception Point, n.d.). Design systems with 'human-in-the-loop' validation for critical decisions influenced by AI outputs (MIAA, 2024).
Rationale: Proactively addresses the novel attack vectors introduced by GenAI, moving beyond traditional security measures to protect against manipulation of AI systems themselves.
Risk Addressed: AI-Powered Social Engineering & Deepfakes (GenAI); Data Poisoning & Integrity Risks (GenAI).

Action: Enhance the effectiveness of EDR and SIEM investments by integrating them with Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platforms to automate routine alert triage and response actions (iboss, n.d.-a). Develop and refine detection rules specifically tailored to healthcare environments (e.g., IoMT anomalies, EHR access patterns). Integrate high-quality threat intelligence feeds relevant to healthcare threats (Threat Intelligence, 2023). Invest in ongoing training and potentially AI-driven tools to help security analysts manage alert volumes, reduce fatigue, and improve proactive threat hunting capabilities (Forenova, 2024).
Rationale: Addresses the critical limitations of EDR/SIEM tools caused by alert fatigue and skills gaps, enabling faster detection and response to genuine threats.
Risk Addressed: Alert Fatigue; Delayed Incident Response; Insufficient Threat Detection across diverse assets (including IoMT).
Recommendation C2: Conduct Rigorous, Targeted Security Testing
Action: Implement a regular program of penetration testing and vulnerability assessments that goes beyond standard network scans. Specifically target high-risk areas such as remote access infrastructure (VPNs, RDP), critical third-party supplier connections, the IoMT device estate, and any deployed AI systems (testing for vulnerabilities like prompt injection or susceptibility to adversarial inputs) (arXiv, 2025b). Use findings to prioritise remediation efforts.
Rationale: Proactively identifies exploitable weaknesses across the expanded and evolving attack surface, including areas often missed by routine scanning.
Risk Addressed: Exploitation of Remote/Hybrid Working (COVID-19); Heightened Supply Chain Risk (NIS2/UK Bill); IoMT Vulnerabilities; AI System Vulnerabilities (GenAI).
Recommendation C3: Enhance Incident Response Planning & Reporting
Action: Develop and regularly test specific incident response (IR) playbooks for key threat scenarios relevant to healthcare, including: large-scale ransomware attacks impacting clinical operations, major supply chain compromises, sophisticated social engineering/deepfake incidents, and potential AI model poisoning or misuse incidents. Ensure IR plans incorporate the stringent reporting timelines mandated by NIS2/UK Bill (initial report within 24 hours, further details within 72 hours) (UK Government, 2023a). Establish clear communication channels with NHS Digital/England CSOC and the NCSC (Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, 2020; DLA Piper, 2024).
Rationale: Improves preparedness for specific, high-impact threats and ensures compliance with stricter regulatory reporting requirements, minimising disruption and potential penalties.
Risk Addressed: Ransomware; Supply Chain Attacks; AI-Powered Social Engineering/Deepfakes; Data Poisoning; NIS2/UK Bill Incident Reporting Requirements.
Recommendation C4: Implement Robust Backup and Recovery
Action: Ensure comprehensive backup strategies are in place for all critical systems and data, including EHRs, clinical applications, and infrastructure configurations. Backups must be stored securely (ideally following the 3-2-1 rule: three copies, two different media, one offsite/offline), protected from ransomware encryption (e.g., immutable storage), and regularly tested through full recovery drills to verify their integrity and the effectiveness of the recovery process (DPO Centre, 2023).
Rationale: Provides a critical fallback mechanism to restore operations and data access following a destructive cyberattack like ransomware, minimising downtime and patient care disruption.
Risk Addressed: Ransomware; Data Loss Incidents; Business Continuity/Disaster Recovery.
D. Supply Chain Security
(CISSP: Security and Risk Management, Asset Security)
Recommendation D1: Embed Security into Procurement & Contracts
Action: Integrate mandatory, verifiable cybersecurity requirements into all procurement processes and supplier contracts, going beyond basic self-attestation. Align these requirements with relevant NHS Commercial framework guidance (NHS England, n.d.-b) and the specific mandates of NIS2/UK Bill regarding supplier security (UK Government, 2023a). Require suppliers (especially of critical software, hardware, or services) to provide evidence of robust security practices (e.g., certifications like Cyber Essentials Plus, ISO 27001, SOC 2 reports, penetration test results) (Thornton and Lowe, 2023a). Include clear clauses on incident reporting, audit rights, and liability.
Rationale: Addresses the regulatory requirements for supplier security assurance and mitigates weaknesses in traditional procurement approaches that often lack deep security vetting.
Risk Addressed: Heightened Supply Chain Risk (NIS2/UK Bill); Vulnerabilities introduced via third parties.
Recommendation D2: Implement Continuous Supplier Risk Monitoring
Action: Establish a program for ongoing monitoring of supplier cybersecurity posture, not just point-in-time assessments during onboarding. Utilise third-party risk management platforms, security ratings services, and targeted assessments to gain visibility into supplier vulnerabilities and compliance status, extending scrutiny beyond direct (Tier 1) suppliers where feasible (Risk Ledger, n.d.). Prioritise monitoring efforts based on supplier criticality, particularly focusing on those potentially designated as 'Critical Suppliers' under the UK Bill (UK Government, 2023a).
Rationale: Addresses the dynamic nature of cyber risk and the lack of ongoing visibility into supplier security, enabling proactive identification and mitigation of emerging threats within the supply chain.
Risk Addressed: Heightened Supply Chain Risk (NIS2/UK Bill); Lack of Supplier Visibility.
Recommendation D3: Conduct Specific Due Diligence for AI Vendors
Action: When procuring AI solutions or services, conduct specific due diligence focused on AI security and data privacy risks. Assess the vendor's data handling practices, the provenance and integrity of training data (querying measures taken against data poisoning), model security testing (including against adversarial attacks), transparency regarding model limitations and biases, and compliance with relevant ICO guidance (Perception Point, n.d.; Osborne Clarke, 2025a). Ensure contractual terms address these specific AI risks.
Rationale: Addresses the unique and often opaque risks associated with the AI supply chain, ensuring that procured AI systems are trustworthy and secure.
Risk Addressed: Data Poisoning & Integrity Risks (GenAI); AI Privacy Risks; Lack of AI Model Transparency.
E. Workforce & Culture
(CISSP: Security and Risk Management)
Recommendation E1: Enhance & Tailor Security Awareness Training
Action: Revamp security awareness training to be engaging, continuous, and behaviour-focused, moving beyond annual compliance exercises. Content must address current, relevant threats, including: sophisticated phishing tactics (recognising AI-generated lures), deepfake awareness (how to spot potential fakes in calls/videos), secure remote working hygiene (home network security, device security), safe use of collaboration tools, and responsible interaction with AI systems (understanding limitations, avoiding input of sensitive data into public models) (Hornetsecurity, 2024). Regularly use realistic phishing simulations to test and reinforce learning (NHS England Digital, n.d.-c).
Rationale: Addresses the persistent threat of human error being exploited by attackers and aims to improve the effectiveness of training beyond basic awareness, tackling specific risks from COVID legacy and GenAI. Mitigates reported gaps in regular training (Digital Health, 2025a).
Risk Addressed: Increased Phishing/Social Engineering (COVID-19); AI-Powered Social Engineering/Deepfakes (GenAI); Exploitation of Remote Working (Human Factor); Insider Threats (Unintentional).
Recommendation E2: Implement Role-Specific Cybersecurity Training
Action: Develop and deliver specialised cybersecurity training tailored to the responsibilities of different roles within the healthcare organisation. Examples include: advanced threat hunting and tool management for SOC analysts; secure coding and AI model security for developers; supplier security assessment techniques for procurement teams; secure configuration and use of IoMT devices and telehealth platforms for clinical staff; data privacy and AI governance for information governance teams (Digital Marketplace, 2024a).
Rationale: Generic awareness training is insufficient for roles with specific security responsibilities. Tailored training equips staff with the necessary skills to manage risks relevant to their function.
Risk Addressed: Skills Gaps across various domains; Ineffective use of security tools; Misconfiguration risks; Unsafe use of specialised technology (IoMT, AI).
Recommendation E3: Foster a Proactive Security Culture
Action: Promote a culture where cybersecurity is viewed as a shared responsibility, integral to patient safety and operational resilience. Encourage staff at all levels to proactively report suspicious activities, potential vulnerabilities, or security incidents without fear of blame ("see something, say something"). Leadership must actively champion and model secure behaviours. Recognise and reward positive security practices (Smith, 2023a).
Rationale: A strong security culture is a critical defence layer that complements technical controls and formal processes. It empowers the workforce to act as human sensors and first responders.
Risk Addressed: All risks (as culture influences response to all threats); particularly Insider Threats and Social Engineering.
F. Software Development Security
(CISSP: Software Development Security)
Recommendation F1: Implement Secure AI/ML Development Practices
Action: For any internally developed or commissioned software, and particularly for AI/ML models, integrate security throughout the development lifecycle (DevSecOps/MLSecOps). This includes secure coding standards, rigorous code reviews, vulnerability scanning (SAST/DAST), software composition analysis (SCA) for third-party libraries, and specific testing for AI vulnerabilities (e.g., robustness against adversarial examples, data validation pipelines to detect potential poisoning, bias testing) (arXiv, 2025b).
Rationale: Builds security and resilience into software and AI systems from the ground up, reducing the likelihood of vulnerabilities being introduced or exploited later. Addresses specific AI integrity risks.
Risk Addressed: Software Vulnerabilities; Data Poisoning & Integrity Risks (GenAI); Insecure AI Code Recommendations (GenAI).
Recommendation F2: Ensure Compliance for Software as a Medical Device (SaMD)
Action: Where software applications (including AI-driven ones) function as medical devices, ensure strict adherence to relevant regulatory requirements, including MHRA guidance and the clinical risk management standards DCB0129 (for manufacturers/developers) and DCB0160 (for deployment) (NHS England, n.d.-a). Maintain thorough documentation for compliance and safety case evidence.
Rationale: Ensures legal compliance and patient safety for software performing clinical functions, integrating cybersecurity risk management with clinical risk management.
Risk Addressed: Regulatory Non-Compliance; Patient Safety risks from SaMD failure/compromise.
4.3 Recommendation Prioritisation and Mapping
Implementing all recommendations simultaneously may be challenging. Organisations should prioritise based on their specific risk assessment, maturity level, and resource availability. The following table provides a mapping of recommendations to risks, CISSP domains, and a suggested initial priority level (High, Medium, Low) for a typical UK healthcare organisation facing these converging threats.
